# Javascript programs outside the browser course

## javascript programs in the browser
1. Native objects-> Are objects provided by the javascript programming language e,g string, array, date, math. They can be used in any environment, not just the browser only.
2. Host objects -> Object provided by the environment. e.g Window, Document, History, XMLHTTPRquest. They only /****run in the browser[I don't think so. I think each environment has it's own hosy objects e.g document for the browser, http or https for the node.js platform]****.
3.I do not know what global objects mean
    ##javascript on the server
1. New objects available for JS outside the browser in the nodejs platform are :http, https, fs, url, os

## So why Use Node.js? Well because it is non-blocking(ASYCHRONOUS)
